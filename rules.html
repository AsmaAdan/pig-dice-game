			<h1>Pig Dice Game</h1>
			<h2>A member of Jeopardy race games</h2>
			<p>Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score</p>

			<h2>Game Play</h2>
			<p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
				<li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
				<li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>

			<h2>Scoring Examples</h2>
			<p>Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue rolling. She rolls seven more times, getting a 6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, and then 1. Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn is over and she earns 0 points for this turn.</li>
				<li>Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times, getting a 3, 4, 2, and 6. He decides to hold (and not take a chance of getting a 1). Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6 = 21).</li>
