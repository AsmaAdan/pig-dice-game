# Pig Dice Game
### An attempt at learning how to make applications using JavaScript.
#### By Asma Adan(https://github.com/AsmaAdan)
##### Learning JavaScript at Moringa School prep requires the setting up of an application using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
##### This particular  application allows two users to play a dice game. 
#####It allows the user to see the score they get for each roll of the dice they make in the game. Furthermore, the application tallies up the points until one player reaches 100 points and declares them a winner  
##### You can take a look at it and let me know any changes I should make or any suggestions you maybe having or how I should make my 

functions better and make the website more appealing. Thank you in advance.
## BDD
#### Want to test how I did this project?
##### Here are the specs:

*The program allows the user to roll the dice when it's their turn to play in the game.

*The program shows the user the score they get for each roll of the dice they make in the game.

*The program alerts when their dice rolls on number 1. This will help them know that they can't roll the dice until the alternate player takes their round.

*The program does not allow the same user to repeat their turn before the other player has their turn

*The program shows the user their cumulative score for each round they play in the game. For example, if they roll the scores 2-6-3 consecutively, they will see their end score as 11.

*The program allows a user to hold their score when they are satisfied with the points they have gained in a round of playing. The game will, therefore, add their held score to their most recent cumulative score.

*The program allows the users to see which player has won the game, which means they have scored 100 points before their gaming partner.
